# ElasticSet

### Didactic project for PR2 course @ Unipi. 

ElasticSet represents a Java collection of generic homogeneous unique objects (no duplicates) with lots of methods to manipulate its elements.

ElasticSetInt.java defines the interface, while ElasticSetImp.java is the actual implementation.

The project contains two main classes (TestTs1.java, TestTs2.java) to test the implementation.
